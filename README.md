# SEEAM - The Peak Steam Remake why is the logo so big help

Welcome to **SEEAM** â€“ your one-stop (and stop often) destination for all things *mediocrely* gaming! Why buy a smooth, polished game management and store app when you can experience all the bugs, glitches, and terrible UI of a *very amazing remake of Steam*?
https://github.com/PSYclownYT/SEEAM/wiki/Development
## Features

### ðŸ‘¾ Half-Working Game Library
Your entire game collection in one (mostly unorganized) place! With SEEAM, you can:
- **Attempt to add games** (no promises on them actually showing up!)
- **SOME SEMI-FUNCTIONAL way to find games** you expect WAY too much of me

# NO SUS VISUAL NOVELS


### ðŸ“œ Goofy Aah Updates
SEEAM updates sometimes, and each update promises:
- **New bugs** that you didnâ€™t know you needed!


### ðŸŽ¯ Personalized Recommendations (if i knew how to code)
Our algorithm takes your favorite games and:
- Recommends completely unrelated titles.
- Sometimes, itâ€™s blank (an accurate assessment of the state of gaming).

## Installation

To install SEEAM, youâ€™ll need:
1. Python 3.x
2. some braincells left (theyll be gone soon trust)
3. git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSYclownYT/SEEAM.git
cd SEEAM
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

If it doesn't start, thatâ€™s intended behavior.

## How to Use

1. Open SEEAM (if it doesnâ€™t crash on startup).
2. If your games arenâ€™t there, go cry in a corner
3. Browse the store when we add it sometime

## Known Bugs

- **UI:** Doesnâ€™t scale well

## Contributing

**Please donâ€™t.** Weâ€™re committed to keeping SEEAM as awful as possible.

### Disclaimer

SEEAM is in no way affiliated with Steam or Valve. In fact, they would probably be horrified to see this project.

Enjoy your barely-functioning app experience with SEEAM!
