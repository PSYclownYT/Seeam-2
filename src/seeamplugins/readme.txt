If your app is intended to modify ANY of seeams internals, it may not be distributed as an app.
thats why i made plugins! by using these, you assume the risks of a outdated or fucked up seeam.

devs of plugins can edit seeam's internals all they want!
(the folder is only if you need to make a GUI, or the plugin doesn't need to run its own version of seeam.)
